# Kill Team Resources
A list of resources for Kill Team (2021 edition, under the Warhammer 40k franchise).

Suggestions/additions are welcome, including descriptions.  Don't be shy if you are a content creator and want to be on this list or want a more complete description.  You can comment on the [announcement reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/killteam/comments/sbw0vw/kill_team_resources_list/), make a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/jmegner/KillTeamResources/issues), or make a [GitHub pull request](https://github.com/jmegner/KillTeamResources/pulls).

Guides and other documents in markdown format are also welcome to become part of this repo directly, like [veddermatic](https://github.com/veddermatic)'s [TTS Kill Team Guide](TTS-Beginners-guide.md).

## Rules And Factions, For Human Consumption

* [Wahapedia](https://wahapedia.ru/kill-team2/the-rules/introduction/) web site.  The best resource for rules and team info.  Very nice layout, linking, and hover-info-boxes. If this list could only have one link, it would be to Wahapedia.
* [ktdash](https://ktdash.app/) web app.  Build rosters. Browse factions, killteams, and operatives. Run games with CP/VP/TP and wound trackers.


## Rules And Factions, For Programmatic Consumption

* [BattleScribeData Kill Team](https://github.com/BSData/wh40k-killteam) repo.  Official data source for BattleScribe.  XML format.
* [killteamjson](https://github.com/vjosset/killteamjson) has faction info in json form.  The readme and file names suggest compendium factions only, but I can see commits for non-compendium factions.


## Calculators and Simulators

Things that calculate or simulate various aspects of gameplay, like various statistics of a shooting or fighting attack.

* [ktcalc/KT21Calculator](https://jmegner.github.io/KT21Calculator/) web app ([source](https://github.com/jmegner/KT21Calculator)).  Uses exact math to calculate outcome probabilities of shooting and fighting attacks.
* [ktsim/KillTeamSimulator2](http://kt2.doit-cms.ru/) web app ([simulation source](https://github.com/ramainen/godicepool)).  Monte Carlo simulator for shooting and fighting attacks.  Inspiration for ktcalc.
* [ktcomp/KillTeamComparativeSimulator](https://denampavel.shinyapps.io/KTSim/) web app ([source](https://github.com/DenamPavel/KillTeamSim)).  Monte Carlo simulator for comparing shooting attacks of two different attackers against a common defender.
* Spreadsheets (often with significant inaccuracies, especially for shooting damage)
  * [KT21](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Sa76-kNCVpLe0sLMEryo7l7QdZZOBqOrkhnENj55Mtc).  Rough estimates of how weapons do against various Sv values.
  * [Weapon Comparison X To Kill](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1heVsyiowkdlBobygPURhX3d-WCSSyXbB).  Incomplete.  Chances to kill in 1 or 2 hits during a fighting attack.
  * [KillTeam Weapon MathHammer V1.0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JJQqxJJf6riibwFHasEjliEhitLuKQiGWUBYZ-lR4io/edit#gid=1040039477).  Lots of entries for various operatives, but pretty inaccurate (calculated average damage can be ~30% of actual average damage).

## Cheatsheets and Reference Sheets

* [XT's Ultimate KT Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wAl4sNYcqybYCYANLbLFYbXuvRfp1PNPGlzr_YGWvtY).  Nice faction cheatsheets.  Has links to other resources.
* [ChronoDK Rules Reference Sheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kgToAvu_TXRmAQIA1kkdLKih4rCJOE6u). Rules one-pager.
* [Armagonix Rules Reference Sheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/killteam/comments/pck4o4/after_some_playtesting_i_have_improved_my_kt21/).  Rules one-pager.

## Roster Building And Data Card Generation

* [BattleScribe](https://www.battlescribe.net/) app for desktop and mobile.  Build rosters.
* [datacard/KT2021Datacards](https://datacard.app/) web app.  Turn BattleScribe rosters into printable datasheets.
* [dataslate](https://dataslate.rocks/) web app.  Turn BattleScribe rosters into printable datasheets.
* [ktdash](https://ktdash.app/) web app.  Build rosters. Browse factions, killteams, and operatives. Run games with CP/VP/TP and wound trackers.
* [ktcg/KillTeamCardGenerator](https://ktcg.netlify.app/) web app ([source](https://github.com/magralol/ktcg)).  Make custom operative data cards.

## Buying Guides

* [Kill Team 21 Team Costs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FyS0Z4h1s2IicJ-riH696Sf58-DYIzz0-qf7YPlZ2GI) and its [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/killteam/comments/py9hz4/kt_min_team_costs_by_faction_updated_with_gbp/) ([older thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/killteam/comments/pafol0/how_much_does_it_cost_to_get_into_kt21_version_11/)).

## Gameplay Assistance

* [kt-tac-ops](https://kt-tac-ops.com/) web app.  Randomly choose your tac ops for play.  You don't need to own the tac ops cards if you are happy with using this site.
* [ktdash](https://ktdash.app/) web app.  Build rosters. Browse factions, killteams, and operatives. Run games with CP/VP/TP and wound trackers.
